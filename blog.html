            <h2>Understanding Business</h2>
            <p>At its core, a business involves the exchange of goods or services for profit. From small-scale operations to multinational corporations, businesses form the backbone of the global economy. Success in business requires a clear understanding of market demands, efficient resource management, and a strategic vision.</p>

            <p>Businesses are categorized into various sectors, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Retail</strong>: Selling products directly to consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: Producing goods for consumption or use.</li>
                <li><strong>Service</strong>: Offering intangible value, such as consulting, education, or hospitality.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Driving innovation through software, hardware, and digital platforms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Makes Entrepreneurship Unique?</h2>
            <p>Entrepreneurship is the art of identifying opportunities and taking calculated risks to create and grow a business. Entrepreneurs are the risk-takers and visionaries who bring fresh ideas to life, disrupt industries, and solve real-world problems.</p>

            <p>Successful entrepreneurs share common traits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creativity</strong>: Thinking outside the box to develop unique solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience</strong>: Bouncing back from failures and learning from setbacks.</li>

        <section id="differences">
            <h2>Key Differences Between Business and Entrepreneurship</h2>
            <p>While businesses focus on maintaining and scaling operations, entrepreneurship emphasizes innovation and creating new ventures. Entrepreneurs often build businesses, but their primary goal is to introduce change and challenge the status quo.</p>

            <p>For instance, starting a new coffee shop is a business, but launching a revolutionary app that reinvents how coffee is delivered could be considered entrepreneurship.</p>
